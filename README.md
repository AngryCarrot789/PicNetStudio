## PicNet Studio
A simple layer-based photo editor, currently very WIP, using Avalonia as the front end

Some ideas I have for the future:
- Plugin support, custom brushes
- Customisable UI, something similar to PixiEditor or C4D
- Multiple editor windows open per instance, tabs movable between windows

## Preview so far
